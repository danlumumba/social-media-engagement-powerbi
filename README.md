## 📊 Turning Data into Tactics

### Transforming Social Media Data into Actionable Insights with Power BI

This dashboard reveals clear pathways to boost social media performance:

1. **Video & Carousel Domination**  
   These formats lead in likes, shares, and comments. Text and images trail behind.

2. **Timing is Everything**  
   Use the “Time of Day vs Engagement” chart to schedule posts when your audience is most active.

Although the sentiment breakdown is balanced (approx. 33% each for positive, neutral, and negative), the most **actionable value** lies in **content format** and **timing**.

👉 _What's one actionable insight your team has gained from your own social media analytics?_
